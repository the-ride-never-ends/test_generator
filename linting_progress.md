# Linting Progress Report - April 17, 2025

## Today's Achievements

1. **Fixed Type Checking Issues**:
   - Fixed None attribute access errors in generator.py by adding proper null checks
   - Fixed incompatible return types in _initialize_template_engine and _get_template
   - Fixed default_factory error in schemas/imports.py using lambda function
   - Updated tests to reflect changes to implementation

2. **Created Comprehensive Analysis Reports**:
   - Created mypy_report.txt documenting error categories and progress
   - Categorized remaining issues by type and priority

3. **Added Pre-commit Configuration**:
   - Created .pre-commit-config.yaml with hooks for:
     - flake8 linting
     - mypy type checking
     - trailing whitespace removal
     - end-of-file fixes
     - YAML, JSON, and TOML validation
     - isort for import sorting

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with all improvements made
   - Updated TODO.md to reflect progress and next steps

## Current Status

- **Tests**: 101/101 passing (100% success rate)
- **Type Checking**: Fixed 20+ errors (30% progress)
- **Linting**: Configuration added, critical type checking errors fixed

## Next Steps

1. Fix Collection type issues in run_tests.py using List instead of Collection
2. Fix name redefinition in generator.py
3. Fix whitespace and formatting issues with pre-commit hooks
4. Test pre-commit hooks to ensure they work as expected

## Overall Progress

The project is making good progress toward being ready for release. The critical type checking issues that could cause runtime errors have been addressed, and a framework for consistent code quality has been established through pre-commit hooks. The remaining issues are primarily style/formatting concerns rather than functional issues.
